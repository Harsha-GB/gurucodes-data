Data Analysts are the professionals who carry out the data analysis process. They act as **detectives**, who sift through huge amounts of raw data to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and trends that can help businesses make better decisions. 

### A Data Analyst's Role Includes:
- **Understanding Business Problems:** A data analyst needs to understand what the business wants to achieve and translate that into a data analysis problem.
- **Retrieving Data:** Using tools like SQL, Python, or Excel to pull the required data from databases or datasets.
- **Cleaning and Organizing Data:** Ensuring the data is clean, free from errors, and organized for analysis.
- **Analyzing Data:** Applying statistical methods or algorithms to extract insights.
- **Visualizing Data:** Creating graphs, charts, and dashboards to present data clearly.
- **Communicating Insights:** Presenting findings to non-technical stakeholders (like managers or decision-makers) in a clear and actionable way.
