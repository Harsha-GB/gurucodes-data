---

Data analysts frequently deal with repetitive tasksâ€”things like daily report generation, data cleaning, and database updates. Python allows you to **automate** these processes.

#### Concepts to Master:
- **Automation with Python:** Automate repetitive tasks like fetching data from a database or cleaning a dataset.
  - Example: Write a Python script that automatically downloads and cleans the latest sales data every day.

- **Scheduling Jobs:** Use libraries like `schedule` or integrate Python with cron jobs to schedule tasks.
  - Example: Schedule a Python script to run a weekly report and email the results to the sales team.

**Why Automation Matters:**  
Automation is a **huge time-saver**. Automating routine tasks not only makes you more efficient but also ensures consistency and accuracy in data handling.
