- **Pivot Tables:** Create multi-dimensional data summaries similar to Excel pivot tables.
  - Example: Analyze sales data by region, product category, and time period simultaneously using Pandas pivot tables.

- **Time Series Analysis:** Manipulate and analyze time-series data, including indexing by dates and resampling data.
  - Example: Analyze stock prices or sales data over time to find seasonal trends.

- **MultiIndexing:** Work with hierarchical indexes in Pandas to perform operations across multiple levels.
  - Example: Sales data for multiple regions and products can be indexed by both, allowing for more granular analysis.

#### B. **Working with APIs and Web Scraping:**
- **APIs:** Retrieve data from online sources (e.g., social media data, financial data) using APIs.
  - Example: Use the `requests` library to pull data from a weather API and analyze trends over time.

- **Web Scraping:** Collect data from websites using tools like **BeautifulSoup** and **Scrapy**.
  - Example: Scrape product prices from an e-commerce website to compare pricing strategies across competitors.

**Why Advanced Python is Essential for Data Analysis:**  
As you handle more complex datasets, youâ€™ll need to work with **API data**, manage **large datasets**, and perform more sophisticated **data wrangling tasks**. Advanced Python concepts, including time-series analysis and web scraping, will help you automate data collection and extend your analytical capabilities.
