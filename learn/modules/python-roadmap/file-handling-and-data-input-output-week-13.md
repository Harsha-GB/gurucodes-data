As a data analyst, you’ll often need to work with files—whether it’s reading data from a CSV, writing output to an Excel file, or processing text files.

#### Concepts to Master:
- **Reading and Writing Files:** How to open, read, write, and close files in Python (e.g., CSV, Excel, and JSON).
  - Example: Use Python’s `open()` function to read in a dataset from a CSV file and process the data.

- **Working with CSV Files:** Python's `csv` module or the Pandas library makes it easy to handle CSV files.
  - Example: Reading a CSV file containing sales data, cleaning it, and exporting it to a new file.

**Why This is Important for Data Analysis:**  
In real-world scenarios, data often comes from external sources such as databases or CSV files. Knowing how to **import and export data** efficiently is the first step to processing and analyzing it.
