# Loops in Python

## Introduction

**Loops** in Python allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true or until a specific condition is met. Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks. Python has two types of loops:

1. **`for` loop**
2. **`while` loop**

You can also control the flow of loops using:
- **`break`**: Terminates the loop.
- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
- **`pass`**: Does nothing and is used as a placeholder.
