title: "String Operations"

### 1. **String Concatenation**
You can concatenate (join) two or more strings using the `+` operator.

```python
first_name = "Vasanta"
last_name = "Kumar"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)
```

**Output:**
```
Vasanta Kumar
```

Here, the `+` operator concatenates `first_name` and `last_name` with a space in between to form `full_name`.

### 2. **String Repetition**
The `*` operator allows you to repeat a string multiple times.

```python
name = "Praveen"
repeat_name = name * 3
print(repeat_name)
```

**Output:**
```
PraveenPraveenPraveen
```

The string `Praveen` is repeated 3 times.
