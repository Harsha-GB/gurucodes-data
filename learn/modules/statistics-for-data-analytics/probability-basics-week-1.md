Data is often random, and probability helps us understand and model that randomness. For a data analyst, understanding probability is crucial for interpreting data correctly and making predictions.

#### Concepts to Master:
- **Basic Probability Rules:**
  - **Addition Rule:** The probability that one of two mutually exclusive events will occur.
  - **Multiplication Rule:** The probability that two independent events will both occur.
  
  **Real-life Example:**  
  If you’re a marketing analyst, and you want to know the probability that a customer will both open an email and click a link, you can use the **multiplication rule** to calculate this probability.

- **Conditional Probability:**
  - **Bayes’ Theorem:** A way to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.
  
  **Real-life Example:**  
  If you’re analyzing whether a customer will purchase based on their past behavior, **Bayes’ Theorem** can help you adjust the probability based on what you know about the customer’s previous purchases.

- **Probability Distributions:**  
  These are functions that show how probabilities are distributed over possible outcomes.

  **Key Distributions to Learn:**
  - **Normal Distribution:** The famous bell curve; most data points are clustered around the mean.
  - **Binomial Distribution:** Used when there are exactly two outcomes (success/failure).
  - **Poisson Distribution:** Used to model the number of times an event happens in a fixed interval.

  **Real-life Example:**  
  **Normal distribution** is often used to model things like test scores or height, where most people cluster around the average. **Poisson distribution** might help you model how often a server will crash in a month.
