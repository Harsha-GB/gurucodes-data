### 1. **Descriptive Statistics**  
This is where every data analyst’s journey with statistics begins. Descriptive statistics help you summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. It’s all about **describing what is happening in the data**.

#### Concepts to Master:
- **Measures of Central Tendency:**
  - **Mean:** The average value of the dataset.
  - **Median:** The middle value that separates the dataset in half.
  - **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value.

  **Real-life Example:**  
  Imagine you’re analyzing the salaries of employees in a company. The **mean salary** might give you an idea of the average, but if a few executives are making huge salaries, the **median** salary (middle value) could be a better representation of what most employees earn.

- **Measures of Spread:**
  - **Range:** The difference between the highest and lowest values.
  - **Variance:** How much the data is spread out from the mean.
  - **Standard Deviation:** A more interpretable version of variance that tells you how much the data varies from the average.

  **Real-life Example:**  
  In the same salary example, the **standard deviation** will tell you how widely salaries vary in the company. A large standard deviation means there’s a big difference between what people earn, while a small standard deviation means salaries are more uniform.

- **Quartiles and Percentiles:**
  - Helps you divide the data into parts or rank data.
  
  **Real-life Example:**  
  When analyzing exam scores, you might want to know the **90th percentile**, which tells you the score below which 90% of students scored. This is useful in competitive exams like the SAT or GRE.
