These methods are used to determine **relationships between variables**. Is there a relationship between marketing spend and sales revenue? Can we predict one variable based on another?

#### Concepts to Master:
- **Correlation Coefficient (r):** Measures how strongly two variables are related.
  - **Pearson Correlation:** Measures the linear relationship between two variables.
  - **Spearman Rank Correlation:** Measures the strength and direction of the association between two ranked variables.

  **Real-life Example:**  
  You might want to know if thereâ€™s a correlation between the amount of money spent on Facebook ads and the number of website visits. A high positive **correlation** would indicate that as ad spending increases, website visits also increase.

- **Linear Regression:** A technique to model the relationship between a dependent variable (outcome) and one or more independent variables (predictors).

  **Real-life Example:**  
  A retail company might use **linear regression** to predict sales based on the amount spent on advertising. The regression equation will give you a formula to make predictions based on advertising spend.

- **Multiple Regression:** Extends linear regression by allowing for more than one independent variable.
  
  **Real-life Example:**  
  You could use **multiple regression** to predict a customer's likelihood of purchasing based on several factors: age, income, location, and previous purchase history.
