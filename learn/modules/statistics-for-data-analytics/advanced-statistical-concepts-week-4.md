Once youâ€™ve mastered the basics, there are a few **advanced topics** that can really help set you apart as a data analyst:

- **Logistic Regression:** Used when the dependent variable is binary (yes/no, 0/1). For example, predicting whether a customer will churn or not.
  
  **Real-life Example:**  
  A telecommunications company might use **logistic regression** to predict whether a customer will cancel their service based on variables like contract length, usage, and customer service interactions.

- **Time Series Analysis:** Used to analyze data that is collected over time (e.g., stock prices, weather data).
  - **Moving Averages:** A technique used to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.
  - **ARIMA Models:** Used for forecasting based on time series data.
  
  **Real-life Example:**  
  A sales analyst might use **time series analysis** to forecast future sales based on past sales data, accounting for trends and seasonal variations.
