title: "Inferential Statistics [Week 2]"

Once you’ve described your data with descriptive statistics, you’ll want to **make predictions or generalizations** from your data. This is where inferential statistics comes into play. It helps you draw conclusions from a sample of data and apply them to a larger population.

#### Concepts to Master:
- **Sampling and Sampling Distribution:**  
  You can't always collect data from every individual in a population. Instead, you collect a sample and use **sampling distributions** to make predictions about the larger population.
  
  **Real-life Example:**  
  Imagine you're working for a retail company and can only collect purchase data from 1,000 customers, but you want to generalize those insights to millions of customers. **Sampling** allows you to estimate characteristics of the entire population using your sample.

- **Confidence Intervals:**
  These give you a range within which you can be fairly certain a population parameter lies (e.g., the mean). 

  **Real-life Example:**  
  If you survey 1,000 customers about their satisfaction and find that the average satisfaction score is 7.5, you might calculate a **confidence interval** that says you’re 95% confident the true average satisfaction score lies between 7.2 and 7.8.

- **Hypothesis Testing:**
  This allows you to test an assumption about a population parameter (like the mean) and decide if it’s likely true or not.

  **Types of Hypothesis Tests:**
  - **t-tests (one-sample, two-sample):** Compare means between groups.
  - **z-tests:** Compare population proportions or means when sample size is large.
  - **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Compare means between three or more groups.
  
  **Real-life Example:**  
  Say you’re testing two versions of a website landing page (A/B testing) and want to see if version B increases conversions. You can use a **t-test** to see if the difference in conversion rates is statistically significant or just due to chance.
