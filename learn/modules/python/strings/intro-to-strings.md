## Introduction to Strings

A **string** in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). Strings are **immutable**, meaning once they are created, their contents cannot be modified. Strings in Python are powerful and come with many built-in methods for manipulation and formatting.

### Example:
```python
name = "Dodagatta Nihar"
greeting = 'Hello, Harsha!'
```

Both `name` and `greeting` are strings in this example. Python treats single-quoted and double-quoted strings the same way.
