Once you know how to write basic Python code, the next step is to learn about **data structures**. These help you organize and manage your data more efficiently.

#### Concepts to Master:
- **Lists:** Ordered collections of items that can store data of different types.
  - Example: A list of customer names or sales figures.

- **Tuples:** Like lists, but immutable (i.e., they cannot be modified after creation).
  - Example: Storing a fixed dataset such as geographical coordinates.

- **Dictionaries:** Store data as key-value pairs, which is extremely useful for fast lookups.
  - Example: Storing customer IDs as keys and their purchase amounts as values.

- **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique elements.
  - Example: A list of unique products purchased by a customer.

**Why These Matter for Data Analysis:**  
Python's data structures allow you to manage and manipulate datasets efficiently. For example, dictionaries can be used to store large amounts of data for quick retrieval based on unique keys (such as customer IDs or product SKUs).
