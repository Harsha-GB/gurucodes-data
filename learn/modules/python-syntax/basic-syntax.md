title: "Python Syntax and Order of Instructions"
---

In Python, the order of instructions is important to ensure the correct execution of a program. Python follows a **top-down** approach, meaning the instructions are executed line by line, from top to bottom.

### Basic Syntax Rules:
1. **Indentation**: Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define blocks of code (e.g., loops, functions, conditionals). Indentation is crucial and should be consistent throughout the code.
   ```python
   if True:
       print("This is indented")
   ```
2. **Comments**: Single-line comments start with `#`, while multi-line comments use triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).
   ```python
   # This is a comment
   """
   This is a multi-line comment
   """
   ```
3. **Statements**: Each instruction (statement) is typically written on a separate line. Multiple statements can be written on the same line by separating them with a semicolon (`;`).
   ```python
   x = 10; y = 20; z = 30
   ```
