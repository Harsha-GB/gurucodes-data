title: "Introduction to Tuples"
---

**Tuples** in Python are similar to lists but with one key difference: they are **immutable**. Once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable, and they are ordered collections of items.

### Key Properties of Tuples:
- **Ordered**: Tuples maintain the order of elements.
- **Immutable**: Once created, the items in a tuple cannot be modified, added, or removed.
- **Allows Duplicates**: Tuples can contain duplicate elements.
- **Dynamic Size**: The size of a tuple can change, but its contents cannot.
