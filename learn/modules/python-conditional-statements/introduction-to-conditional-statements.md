## Introduction

**Conditional statements** in Python are used to execute a block of code based on certain conditions. They are essential for decision-making in programs, allowing the program to behave differently depending on the conditions. The basic structure of conditional statements includes:

1. **if**
2. **elif**
3. **else**

Additionally, we have **nested conditional statements** to evaluate multiple layers of conditions.
