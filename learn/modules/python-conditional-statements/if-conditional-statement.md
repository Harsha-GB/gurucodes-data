## `if` Statement

The `if` statement evaluates a condition, and if the condition is `True`, the code block inside the `if` statement is executed.

### Syntax:
```python
if condition:
    # code block to execute if the condition is True
```

### Example:
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print(f"{x} is greater than 5")
```

**Output:**
```
10 is greater than 5
```

### Real-world Example:
Dodagatta Nihar checks if the temperature is high enough to go for a swim:
```python
temperature = 32
if temperature > 30:
    print("Dodagatta Nihar can go for a swim.")
```

**Output:**
```
Dodagatta Nihar can go for a swim.
```
