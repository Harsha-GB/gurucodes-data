Here, are the key elements which you need to perfom the entire CI process:

- **Version Control System (VCS):** It offers a reliable method to centralize and preserve changes made to your project over time.
- **Virtual Machine:** You should have a spare server or at least one virtual machine to build your system.
- **Hosted CI Tool Solutions:** To avoid servers or virtual machines, you should go for hosted CI tool solutions. This tool helps in the maintenance of the whole process and offers easier scalability.
- **Tools:** If you select a self-hosted variant, you will need to install one of the many CI tools like Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo, GitLab, etc.

# How Continuous integration work?

You are surely aware of the old phone Nokia. Nokia used to implement a procedure called nightly build. After multiple commits from diverse developers during the day, the software built every night. Since the software was built only once in a day, it's a huge pain to isolate, identify, and fix the errors in a large codebase.

Later, they adopted the Continuous Integration approach. The software was built and tested as soon as a developer committed code. If any error is detected, the respective developer can quickly fix the defect.
