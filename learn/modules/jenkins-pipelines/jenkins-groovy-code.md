CI process

- Ideally, the build should come from the command line and should not depend on IDE.
- The build should happen continuously using a dedicated Cl server, not a cron job.
- CI built should be triggered on every check-in and not just at midnight
- The build should provide immediate feedback and Require no developer effort
- Identify key metrics and track them visually. More importantly, act on them immediately
