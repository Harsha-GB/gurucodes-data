| Feature                | Python                         | Java                           | C++                            | JavaScript                    | Ruby                           |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Syntax**             | Simple, readable               | Verbose, requires more code    | Complex, requires manual memory management | Less readable compared to Python | Simple and clean               |
| **Type System**        | Dynamically typed              | Statically typed               | Statically typed               | Dynamically typed              | Dynamically typed              |
| **Execution**          | Interpreted                    | Compiled (JVM)                 | Compiled                       | Interpreted                    | Interpreted                    |
| **Memory Management**  | Automatic (Garbage collection) | Automatic (Garbage collection) | Manual (Developers handle it)  | Automatic                      | Automatic                      |
| **Main Use Cases**     | Data Science, Web Development, Automation, AI, Scripting | Enterprise applications, Android apps | System Software, Game Development, Performance-critical applications | Web Development, Frontend scripting | Web Development, Scripting     |
| **Speed**              | Slower (due to interpretation) | Faster (JIT compilation)       | Fast                           | Fast (JIT with V8 engine)      | Slower (similar to Python)     |
| **Community Support**  | Strong, large libraries        | Large community, vast libraries | Large community, excellent libraries for system-level work | Very large due to web popularity | Moderate, popular for web development |
| **Learning Curve**     | Easy, beginner-friendly        | Steeper than Python            | High due to complexity         | Moderate, but quirks exist     | Easy to moderate               |
